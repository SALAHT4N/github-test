Git and GitHub
--------------------
* if we tried to delete a branch that wasn't merged, then we must use -D instead of -d.
** GitHub 
* There is one shared repository that is stored online, every user takes a copy of it as his local 
  repo, then shen he finishes his feature, he pushes the code to merge it with the master branch of 
  the shared repo.

  it's like every user is a branch of the master branch in the shared repository.

  git remote add origin link : to make an alias.


* git push origin master
  the last argument is the name of the branch that is stored locally and want to upload,
  not the name of the one in the remote.
  so regardless of what branch we are currently checking out, we can push any branch we 
  desire.
