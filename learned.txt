Git and GitHub
--------------------
* if we tried to delete a branch that wasn't merged, then we must use -D instead of -d.
** GitHub 
* There is one shared repository that is stored online, every user takes a copy of it as his local 
  repo, then shen he finishes his feature, he pushes the code to merge it with the master branch of 
  the shared repo.

  it's like every user is a branch of the master branch in the shared repository.

  git remote add origin link : to make an alias.
